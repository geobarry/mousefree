windows accessibility text selection
loosely modeled after navigation commands found in talon community
requires that software has correctly implemented windows Ui automation
tested and works well in Microsoft word, power point and outlook, with some caveats
most notably, it seems to sometimes be messed up by bullets 

We will go through patterns using keywords select, extend, replace and go
these patterns can be used on either dynamic or static targets
We will also see how we can apply formatting or switch between homophones
A final function will look at will be selecting and extending by paragraph
Lastly, will look at one quirk in the current implementation in which partial words are sometimes selected accidentally

basic pattern: select next/previous target

select the next limit de vertices
select previous floating point precision errors

static versus dynamic navigation targets

go after next word efficiency
go after next number fifty
go before next brief United States geological survey
go after next comma

select
select previous metrics of distance
extend after next character period
select from previous metrics to period
format upper previous distance


select paragraph
